# SnL-DBMS
Repository for Storing Old School Database Management System

This repository was created for the intent of storing a database management system I created for a school project.
The DBMS stores information about books from free limited datasets online, and allows users to view them, as well as edit the database if they are cleared to do so.

The DBMS was built in Java, using javafx for the interface and h2 for the database.
The database and classes are included, while the jar for h2 and other miscellaneous files are not.

This DBMS was a great learning experience, and could be heavily improved in future work. I created this on my own while researching how to create each part myself over the matter of a few weeks.
